# Build A Formik Form
 We build a form using formik with field validation
 
# Description of Project:
We used npm to install React, Formik, and any other required libraries. Then, we create a form that contains Email field,
Password field, Submit button. We also create validations on Email field and Password field. The validation rules are:
1.) If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the text input.
2.) If the username is not in an email format, display the message "Username should be an email" under the text input.
3.) If the username and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.

# How to Run: 
1.) You need to download the code to your local folder.
2.) Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files)
3.) Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
4.) Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

# Roadmap of future improvements:
I plan to add more fields with additional validation rules.
